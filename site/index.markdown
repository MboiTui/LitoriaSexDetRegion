## Structure

In this supplementary material we cover all the code for data processing and analyses.

### Linkage mapping with LepMap3

### Identification of Sex-linked and Sex-associated markers

1. [Genotype all lineages together](1_ProcessRadtags.html)
2. [Assess population structure](2_PopulationStructure_pub.html)
3. [Genotype by lineage](3_GenotypeByLineage.html)
4. [Filter low call rate individuals](4_FilterIndividuals.html)

### Mapping candidate sex determination genes

### Compare linkage maps and genome assembly

### Make publication figures

### R and packages version summary

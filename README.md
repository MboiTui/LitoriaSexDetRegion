# Identifying the candidate sex-determining region in *Litoria*
In this repository I have scripts and file for the github page which presents the code used in Bertola et al. (2024) A candidate sex determination region in Australo-Papuan Treefrogs suggests a conserved role for Dmrt genes in anurans

Most of the code should be already available, but please be aware that there are a couple of files missing and/or being updated as the paper undergoes review. Thus please wait for publication for the final version.

If you have any questions about any of the steps, or if something is unclear, please do not hesitate to contact me and let me know. Always happy to incorporate constructive criticism.
